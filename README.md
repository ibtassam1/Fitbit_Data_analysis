# Fitbit_Data_analysis
A broad-ranging data analysis of my personal Fitbit data from 2021 to 2022. The analysis was used as part of a data story I published on Notion. The story included both the analysis in Python as well as visuals from Tableau.

The story revealed some interesting patterns and insights that I discussed in the Notion story linked in the notebook.
